Objects
======
Objects are like JS objects.

However any object _can_ be made into a function

A Function is an object which has the `action` property set, and `inputmap` property set.


`inputmap` can either be a reference map literal such as `(x,y)`

Note:

Reference map literals also appear when assigning multiple variables at once:
`(x,y)<-[10,21]`
